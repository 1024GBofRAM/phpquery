phpQuery support *server-side* events, same as jQuery handle client-side ones. On server there isn't, of course, events such as _mouseover_ (but they can be triggered).

By default, phpQuery automatically fires up only *change* event for form elements. If you load WebBrowser plugin, *submit* and *click* will be handled properly - eg submitting form with inputs' data to action URL via new Ajax request.

Implemented are following jQuery methods.
====Event Handling====
 * *`bind($type, $data, $fn)`* Binds a handler to one or more events (like click) for each matched element. Can also bind custom events.
 * *`one($type, $data, $fn)`* Binds a handler to one or more events to be executed once for each matched element.
 * *`trigger($type, $data)`* Trigger a type of event on every matched element.
 * *`triggerHandler($type, $data)`* This particular method triggers all bound event handlers on an element (for a specific event type) WITHOUT executing the browsers default actions.
 * *`unbind($type, $data)`* This does the opposite of bind, it removes bound events from each of the matched elements.
====Event Helpers====
 * *`change()`* Triggers the change event of each matched element.
 * *`change($fn)`* Binds a function to the change event of each matched element.
 * *`select()`* Trigger the select event of each matched element.
 * *`select($fn)`* Bind a function to the select event of each matched element.
 * *`submit()`* Trigger the submit event of each matched element.
 * *`submit($fn)`* Bind a function to the submit event of each matched element.
