Traversing related methods.
====Filtering====
 * *`eq($index)`* Reduce the set of matched elements to a single element.
 * *`hasClass($class)`* Checks the current selection against a class and returns true, if at least one element of the selection has the given class.
 * *`filter($expr)`* Removes all elements from the set of matched elements that do not match the specified expression(s).
 * *`filter($fn)`* Removes all elements from the set of matched elements that does not match the specified function.

====Finding====
 * *`add($expr)`* Adds more elements, matched by the given expression, to the set of matched elements.
 * *`children($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements.
 * *`contents()`* Find all the child nodes inside the matched elements (including text nodes), or the content document, if the element is an iframe.
 * *`find($expr)`* Searches for all elements that match the specified expression. This method is a good way to find additional descendant elements with which to process.
 * *`next($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing the unique next siblings of each of the given set of elements.
 * *`nextAll($expr)`* Find all sibling elements after the current element.
 * *`parent($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing the unique parents of the matched set of elements.
 * *`parents($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing the unique ancestors of the matched set of elements (except for the root element). The matched elements can be filtered with an optional expression.
 * *`prev($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing the unique previous siblings of each of the matched set of elements.
 * *`prevAll($expr)`* Find all sibling elements before the current element.
 * *`siblings($expr)`* Get a set of elements containing all of the unique siblings of each of the matched set of elements. Can be filtered with an optional expressions.
